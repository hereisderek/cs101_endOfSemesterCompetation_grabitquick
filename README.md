##########   my change  ###########################
1. change the initial position of villian to random 
	(in case of the money showed up in the centre of game area, but make sure not to close to out HERO. LOL, Go, Hero!)
2. make the villains move towards out hero (HOWEVER, our hero is still unbeatable!)
3. use arrow:(up down left right) or kay:(w s a d) to control 
4. the cell with money may change position randonly in a certain posibality
5. when hit the villians, a dialog will pop up to show some infomation
6. use [ESC] to reset the game
7. you can submit your score online and see others' score
	( i made great effort to to this, i set up a website, used PHP (get method), for secority reason i used md5 to process date, score, even a random number and compare with server, you can tell from my source file Submit.java; used MySQL to store the message)
8. you can shoot the villian (trust, this make the game even harder, it's hard to contral the hero while shoot the villians)


up key to speed up

9!    while in the game, type arraw key  [up] [up] [down] [down] [left] [right] [left] [right] [B] [A] to start a easer egg - racing game
